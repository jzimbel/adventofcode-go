# Advent of Code solutions

This project holds my Go solutions + utilities for **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** puzzles over the years.

## Prereqs
To run solutions and tests, the following must be true:
1. The `$GOPATH` env var is set
2. This repository is cloned into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/jzimbel/adventofcode-go`
3. Your `$PATH` includes `$GOPATH/bin`

## Run it
```sh
$ go install github.com/jzimbel/adventofcode-go
$ adventofcode-go <year> <day>
```

## Test it
```sh
$ go test github.com/jzimbel/adventofcode-go
```

## Copy it
If you like the setup I've got here, feel free to use it yourself. Or let me know if it's garbage! This is my first time making a proper Go project from scratch, so I'm sure it's not perfect. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
